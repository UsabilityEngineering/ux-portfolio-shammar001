# Sophie's UX Portfolio

My name is Sophie Hammar. I am a CS major and double minoring in psychology and communications design. My professional goals are based solely on being creative and helping others -- which is why I am excited to have stumbled into the world of UX research and design. I love collaboration and am looking forward to working with you all this summer
